              <h1>My Story</h1>
              <p>
                Growing up, my family was fortunate enough to own a little restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. But as a kid, I hated it. I hated that I had to work there every summer break. I hated that I rarely got to see my parents during the day. And I really hated how exhausted and stressed it made them. 
              </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="section-text">
              <p>
                Yet, everytime I look back on those memories, I can't help but smile fondly. I can't help but remember all of the adventures I had with my siblings. Or all of the friendly regulars who made my mom smile. Or how proud my dad looked every night he locked those doors behind us.
              </p>

                Although it's been over a decade ago since it closed, it's incredible how much of an impact that tiny restuarant still has on me. Working those hot summers has taught me the values of hard work and sacrifice. Watching my mom interact with the customers has shown me the importance of relationships and community. Seeing the pride and joy my dad felt building something that was entirely his own has inspired me to pursue a fellowship with Venture For America.

              <p>
                What I wasn't able to realize as a kid back then was how much those experiences at that restaurant molded me into the person I am today. As I navigate the future looking to create something I can call mine, I'll forever cherish that tiny little corner we called ours.

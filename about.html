          <p>
            Growing up, my family was fortunate enough to have our own little restaurant nestled in the corner of a strip mall. But as a kid, I hated it. I hated that I had to work there every summer break. I hated that I rarely got to see my parents during the day. And I really hated how exhausted and stressed it made them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, everytime I look back on those memories, I can't help but feel grateful. I'm reminded of all of the fun adventures I had with my siblings. And all of the laughter and smiles exchanged between my mom and our regulars. And I can never forgot how proud my dad looked every morning when he unlocked those two front doors.
          </p> 
          <p>
            It's incredible how much of an impact that tiny restuarant had on me. Working those summers had instilled in me the values of hard work and sacrifice. Watching my mom interact with our customers had shown me the importance of relationships and community. Seeing my dad so full of pride and joy taught me the power of forging your own path and meaning.
          </p> 
          <p>
            What I wasn't able to realize as a kid back then was how much those experiences molded me into the person I am today. And as I head into this next chapter with Venture for America, looking to build a purpose of my own, I'll forever cherish that tiny little corner we used to call ours.
